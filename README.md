# **All-India APMC Market Intelligence Tool**

This project is a Python-based command-line application that provides real-time market intelligence for agricultural commodities across India. It scrapes live and historical price data from the government's Agmarknet portal, performs an on-demand analysis, and delivers a concise report to help farmers and traders make informed decisions.

(This is an example of the final report generated by the tool)

The Problem
Farmers across India often lack easy access to consolidated, up-to-date market information. Prices for the same crop can vary significantly between different markets (mandis), even within the same state. The official government portals, while comprehensive, can be slow and difficult to use, especially for comparing prices. This information gap can lead to farmers selling their produce at suboptimal prices, directly impacting their livelihood.

This tool solves that problem by automating the data collection and analysis process, delivering actionable insights directly to the user's terminal.

Features
All-India Coverage: Scrapes data for any state or Union Territory in India.

On-Demand Analysis: Fetches and analyzes the latest available data in real-time when the script is run.

Intelligent User Input: Flexible matching allows users to input state and commodity names in any case (e.g., banana or Banana).

Live Market Report: For the most recent day with data, it provides:

The average price for the selected commodity in that state.

The market with the highest price.

The market with the lowest price.

Trend Analysis: Compares the latest average price to the previous day's average to show the market trend (UP or DOWN).

Robust Scraping: Built with Selenium to handle the complexities of the government's ASP.NET website.

Precise Filtering: Uses a comprehensive internal database of all Indian districts to ensure the final report is accurately filtered for the selected state.

How It Works
State & Commodity Selection: The tool prompts the user to select a state and enter a commodity. It uses fuzzy matching to find the correct official names.

Live Scraping: It launches a Selenium-controlled web browser (in headless mode) and navigates to the Agmarknet portal for the selected state.

Historical Data Fetch: It programmatically queries the portal for the last 4 days of data for the chosen commodity to account for any publication delays.

Data Cleaning & Processing: The raw scraped data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Prices are converted to numeric types, and dates are standardized.

State-Specific Filtering: The script uses an internal dictionary of all districts in India to precisely filter the DataFrame, keeping only the records relevant to the user's selected state.

Analysis & Reporting: The final, cleaned data is analyzed to find the two most recent days with data, calculate key metrics (average, highest, lowest prices), and determine the market trend.

Report Generation: A clean, formatted report is printed directly to the user's terminal.
